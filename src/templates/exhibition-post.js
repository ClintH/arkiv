// NOTE
/* Project posts in exhibitions currently have `exhibiton-post` as a template key.
 I don't render these on their own, but Gatsby rightfully complains when it can't find 
 the corresponding template. So instead of changing all of the template keys with a quick sed
 I kept this here, in case there comes a point when one wants to have an exhibit with posts.
