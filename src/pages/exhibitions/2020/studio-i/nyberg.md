Digital interfaces often takes place on cold, hard, glass surfaces, which limits how a designer can use affordances in a digital system. Or does it? This project explores real materials, digital interfaces, and how they may relate to each other. How a digital interface can hold affordances and qualities like textures from the physical world, and how it can be used as affordances in a GUI. And what it would be like if, like a real life texture, it got older over time.
