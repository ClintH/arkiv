Working with sound in interaction design to create an elevated experience with a classic GUI. Experiments have been done with sound to classic GUI elements and then evaluated to see what sort of emotions that will create with the used. Questions like: Can we create a calmer experience? Or can we increase the intensity of an interaction with sounds? In the end all the different parts where added up to an ambient, full scale GUI with sounds. Resulting in a forest background with birds singing and all the other sounds are collected from the forest etc.
