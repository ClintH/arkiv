We touch and we are touched. When interacting with computers, are you touching the computer or is the computer touching you? In this project I experimented with touch as a material that has variable intensities. Focusing mostly on the intensity of the motion, I explored how we can be touched by our own touch, how touch can create emotions and lastly how touch can allow us "see" with our tactile senses.
