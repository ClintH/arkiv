Year 1 students have for 5 weeks been designing for *connecting people over distance* â€” mainly within the three domains of *leisure,* *work* or *close relations.* The projects are individual and built on a full design process from fieldwork to prototyping as well as a prior extensive literature and design review. The design works and insights will also be presented in the scholarly format of a Pictorial.
