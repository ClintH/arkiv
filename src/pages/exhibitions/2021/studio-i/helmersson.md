In this redesign the focus is on the interaction between material being shared on screen and the presenter of the material. Therefore, the presenterâ€™s camera is moved on top of the shared material to increase visibility of the presenter. This in its turn also leads to the presenter being able to physically interact with the material i.e., pointing to it. The point of this redesign is to get the ball moving and exploring how we can interact more with the shared material.
