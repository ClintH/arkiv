An occurring problem in todayâ€™s video game community is toxic behavior between players. The report system that I created is for the popular game Drunken Wrestler 2. It is built upon four different concepts each which have been developed by insights from both interviews and user testing. The project aims to create a report system that does not exclude an unsportsmanlike player from the game, instead focusing on changing their behavior through punishments that affect their gameplay.
