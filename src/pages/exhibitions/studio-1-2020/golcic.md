Locomotion within VR is typically done using a controller. To look around in VR, you just turn your head. So there is a disparity between not using your real life movements for locomotion and doing so do for moving your head. This is partly the reason for motion sickness. This project investigated different ways of locomotion input, such as IRL walking for in-virtual environment locomotion and body and arm movement for flight.
