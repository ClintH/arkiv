Have you ever wondered what a touch-less interaction could look like or what it could consist of? This project aims to show and tell three different properties of the UltraSonic Sensor HC-SR04/HC-SR05: Depth, Motion and Direction. In my pursuit of these properties a demonstrative box have been built and fitted with an arduino. The exploration of these three properties allows for a greater understanding of the sensor, but also allow you to see the opportunities there are within this type of material.
