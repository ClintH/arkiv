I present 3 material samples, each with different properties that allow for unique interactions. The samples show how drastically different malluable lightsources could be, while showcasing how the differences allow for interactions of various kinds. Along with this it also showcases, through experiments, how a malluable lightsource can be shaped to probe and reveal areas, or concentrate the light into small spaces by shaping the source.
