This project takes a closer look into how movements can be seen as material within interaction design forming tangible outputs. It contains inspirational bits which are created to expose three themes: 'Space and depth', 'Complex vs non-complex movements' and 'The language of movements'. The aim is to invite stakeholders to see space as a resource to be exploited in future design work, to get more familiar with what it means to predict and control movements and in general get more used to approach the material 'movements' as a container of a broad spectrum with design opportunities which is yet to be further discovered.
