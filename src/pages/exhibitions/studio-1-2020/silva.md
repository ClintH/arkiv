This project aims to explore the phenomenon of the oddly satisfying through playful interaction. Drawing inspiration from Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) media, the user will generate images on a screen through the manipulation of selected materials commonly labeled as "oddly satisfying" while listening to music, in a multisensorial experience. The purpose of this interface (still in the development phase) will be to serve as an at-home therapy alternative to relieve stress and anxiety.
