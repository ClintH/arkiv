This study looks at the properties of eye tracking devices and provides examples of how they can be used as design materials. Firstly, an overview will be given on the subject that covers different techniques and housings. Subsequently, one of the shown techniques will have its properties unveiled through a process of ‘unblackboxing’. These properties will then be examined with the goal of inspiring further creativity within the area.
