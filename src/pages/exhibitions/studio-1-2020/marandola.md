Interactive videos as a way for testing prototypes, with the aim of helping existing tools with a re-usable, structured open source method. Video is the key for visual impact, while interaction brings an early stage prototype to a slightly higher fidelity. Users are guided to the interactive video, where the multiple option to explore the prototype allow designers to collect feedbacks on specific qualities highlighted in the prototype. Black Mirror Bandersnatch has been the first inspiration to develop this method and also my view on videos not only as an entertainment tool, but as a real and tangible help for designers.
