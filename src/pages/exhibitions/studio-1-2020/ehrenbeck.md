My project is an examination of how paper and microcontrollers can be used in conjunction to achieve a primitive version of ubiquity. Essentially this project is an examination of how the cheap cost of paper, coupled with its pliability, and easy access, can be used by manufacturers, creatives, and people with an interest to add interactivity into paper and use it as a versatile tool to add functionality into many different facets of life subsequently.
