In a four-week project, students in the first year _Digital Prototyping_ course engaged with the [UN Sustainability Goals](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs) and notions of speculative design, discursive design and design fiction.

The goal was to generate knowledge in and through a speculative design approach, utilising digital materials and prototyping techniques around a chosen theme of sustainable development.

The object(s) produced are meant to be _discursive_, not functional.

Students were to avoid:
* One-liners: projects which hinge on a simplistic or superficial perspective of sustainability
* _Black Mirror_ rejects: overly dramatic dystopian futures lacking subtlety or openness for questioning/interpretation
( A better mousetrap: the concepts and artifacts produced in the design work are not supposed to embody a solution (eg an app to help people sort rubbish).

_Greta_ proposes a shoulder-mounted audio shroud which gives constant audio feedback on the sustainability impact of products around you. Reflecting that sustainability is multi-dimensional and individuals care about different factors, an app allows the user to change a filter. For example, distinguishing products by how far away they were produced, their total carbon footprint and so on.
