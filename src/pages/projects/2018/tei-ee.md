Today, objects around us can be interconnected and communicate to each other. Inviting computers onto our bodies opens for new kinds of interactions. Our case study imagines smart clothes as a "second skin" to embody emotions. In the context of "feeling close to a loved one", human gestures were explored to understand the future potential for haptic feedback.
