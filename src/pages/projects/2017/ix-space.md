In this three-week module in _Interactivity_, students explored the phenomenological understanding of space with the material of web technology.

In _Interactivity_ students purposefully do not create concepts or solve problems, they are engaged with pure experimentation and building knowledge through design.

"What was almost immediately striking was that the seemingly more structured grid of the categorized objects in fact werenâ€™t significantly easier to navigate as such, once we had familiarized ourselves with a particular layout (although the division of the different categories made it easier to understand the context of a certain group of objects on the screen)." - Cronquist

"While having an endless (working) space might seem tempting (and is certainly possible), removing any dimensions makes it very hard to comprehend such space or navigate in it. We only understand space by understanding how the things in it relate to each other and to the dimensions of the space itself. Removing the possibility to compare things to the dimensions of the space puts even more pressure onto being able to compare things in space to each other. So, for instance, when working with text in an endless space, one needs to think how text can be made into landmarks that would help user find their way around." - Kovtun
