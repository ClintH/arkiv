In this three-week module in _Interactivity_, students explored the notions of implicit interaction with computer vision techniques.

In _Interactivity_ students purposefully do not create concepts or solve problems, they are engaged with pure experimentation and building knowledge through design.

"One thing that the way we constructed the sketched did do was change the basic structure of the primary interaction; normally we move our gaze further down the page as we are reading, but now we suddenly asked the user to remain on the same point on the page, as the text moved, thus changing the essence of that interaction." - Cronquist
