In this two-week module in _Interactivity_, students had to explore the interactive possibilities of a single component: a servo motor that is both an actuator and input device.

In _Interactivity_ students purposefully do not create concepts or solve problems, they are engaged with pure experimentation and building knowledge through design.

"Through all these experiments, the most striking thing for me was how strong the sensation of being somehow connected physically with the servo (although remotely) was when it moved in scale, in real-time with our movements. The sensation was also much stronger than using a representation on the screen that moved around according to the userâ€™s input." - Cronquist
